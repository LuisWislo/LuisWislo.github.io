              Says that traffic congestion is actually the solution of people’s mobility problem
              (not an ideal one, mind you). Peak hours occur because school and work are required
              to happen at the same time so people can interact with each other. This happens in
              every major metropolitan area in the world.
              <br><br>
              “That basic requirement cannot be altered without crippling our economy and society.”
              <br><br>
              He believes that most proposed solutions can make the problem even worse (paid lanes,
              demolition of buildings, etc.). There is no way to completely eliminate congestion,
              but it is possible to mitigate it.

              On its first “challenge paper”, the working group looked at technology and policy measures that could reduce traffic
              congestion in the most critical transport sectors by 2030.
              <br><br>
              Since the Department of Transport predicts an increase of congestion of 55% by 2040, the team behind the paper has
              evaluated which measures would be effective and easy on the wallet. One of the most popular solutions was road pricing
              schemes. Although controversial, they are the best way to tackle the problem, as they influence the time of travel,
              chosen routes and incites the use of public transportation.
              <br><br>
              Professor Andrew McNaughton FREng, who led the group which produced the challenge paper, says: “Our country and economy
              are growing. Our transport systems are struggling to cope. Building new capacity is vital but not the universal answer.
              This challenge paper sets out how we can get on top of congestion, but only if we integrate technology advances and policy
              initiatives, and only if we act now. Working together, government, engineers and regulators can make a difference.”
